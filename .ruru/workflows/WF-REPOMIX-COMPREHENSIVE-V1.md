# Workflow: Comprehensive Repomix Generation

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To provide a standard, repeatable procedure for generating comprehensive, chunked documentation context from specified source code repositories or local paths using the `repomix` tool. This includes gathering inputs interactively, handling remote repositories via cloning, confirming the chunking strategy with the user, configuring the tool, executing it, generating a summary README, optionally archiving artifacts, and cleaning up temporary files.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   This workflow applies when the Repomix Specialist (`MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX`) is tasked with performing a "Comprehensive Generation" as defined in its rules.
*   It covers tasks involving both local workspace paths and remote Git repositories as sources.
*   It mandates the creation of both single combined outputs (MD, XML) and chunked outputs (MD, XML), along with code compression.
*   It includes interactive steps for gathering sources, confirming the task name, confirming the chunking strategy, and optional artifact archiving.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **`prime-coordinator` (or other initiating Lead/Manager):**
    *   Initiates the workflow by delegating the task to `MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX`.
    *   Receives the final completion report and path to the results.
*   **`MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX` (Repomix Specialist):**
    *   Executes the core steps of the workflow.
    *   Interacts with the user to gather source paths.
    *   Analyzes sources and suggests task names.
    *   Interacts with the user to confirm the task name.
    *   Determines paths and names based on confirmed inputs.
    *   Performs Git cloning if required.
    *   Analyzes sources and proposes chunking strategies.
    *   Interacts with the user to confirm the chunking strategy.
    *   Generates the `config.repomix.json`.
    *   Executes the `repomix` command.
    *   Generates the summary `README.md`.
    *   Performs cleanup.
    *   Interacts with the user regarding artifact archiving.
    *   Reports completion or errors back to the initiator.
*   **`user`:**
    *   Provides the source paths/URLs when prompted.
    *   Selects or provides the task name when prompted.
    *   Selects the desired chunking strategy when prompted.
    *   Decides whether to archive generated artifacts when prompted.

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   The initiating agent (`prime-coordinator`) has delegated the task to `MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX`.
*   The `MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX` agent has access to the necessary tools: `execute_command` (with `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`), `write_to_file`, `ask_followup_question`, and `attempt_completion`.
*   The `repomix` command-line tool is installed and accessible in the execution environment.
*   The user is available to respond to prompts regarding source paths, task name, chunking strategy, and artifact archiving.

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*Note: The following steps are primarily executed by the `MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX` agent upon receiving the task delegation, with user interaction where noted.*

*   **Step 1: Gather Sources (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX, User)**
    *   **Description:** Obtain the list of source paths or Git URLs from the user.
    *   **Inputs:** User request/delegation message.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `ask_followup_question` to prompt the user for the source paths.
            *   **Question:** "Please provide the source paths or Git URLs for Repomix analysis (comma-separated if multiple)."
            *   **Suggestions:**
                *   "./src"
                *   "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
                *   "./project-a/src, ./project-b/lib"
                *   "Enter custom path(s)/URL(s)..."
        2.  Receive and store the user's provided source list `[source_list]`.
    *   **Outputs:** `[source_list]` (list of strings).
    *   **Error Handling:** If user interaction fails, report blockage to coordinator.

*   **Step 2: Determine & Confirm Task Name (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX, User)**
    *   **Description:** Generate task name suggestions based on sources and confirm with the user.
    *   **Inputs:** `[source_list]` (from Step 1).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Analyze the `[source_list]` (e.g., repository names, directory names).
        2.  Generate 2-3 concise, filesystem-safe task name suggestions (e.g., `repo_analysis`, `src_docs`, `multi_source_context`).
        3.  Use `ask_followup_question` to present suggestions and allow custom input:
            *   **Question:** "Please select or provide a task name for this Repomix run:"
            *   **Suggestions:**
                *   "[Suggestion 1]"
                *   "[Suggestion 2]"
                *   "[Suggestion 3]"
                *   "Enter a custom task name..."
        4.  Receive the user's selection or custom input. Store the confirmed name as `[task_name]`.
    *   **Outputs:** User-confirmed `[task_name]` string.
    *   **Error Handling:** If user interaction fails, report blockage to coordinator.

*   **Step 3: Prepare Task Directory (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Create the main directory for this task's outputs and temporary files, incorporating the confirmed task name and a timestamp.
    *   **Inputs:** `[task_name]` (from Step 2).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Generate a current timestamp `[timestamp]` (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`).
        2.  Construct the task directory path: `[task_directory] = .ruru/docs/repomix/[task_name]-[timestamp]/`.
        3.  Use `execute_command` to create the directory: `mkdir -p [task_directory]`. Verify OS-specific syntax if necessary (though `mkdir -p` is common).
        4.  Define the temporary clone path: `[temp_clone_path] = [task_directory]/temp_clone/`.
    *   **Outputs:** Created `[task_directory]`. Defined `[temp_clone_path]`. `[timestamp]` string.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report failure to create directory back to coordinator.

*   **Step 4: Clone Remote Sources (If Applicable) (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Download source code from remote Git repositories if specified in the gathered sources.
    *   **Inputs:** `[source_list]` (from Step 1). `[temp_clone_path]` (from Step 3).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Identify any remote Git URLs in `[source_list]`.
        2.  Initialize an empty list `[final_source_paths]`.
        3.  For each item in `[source_list]`:
            *   If it's a remote Git URL:
                *   Use `execute_command`: `git clone --depth 1 [repo_url] [temp_clone_path]`. (Note: This clones *into* temp_clone. If multiple repos are needed, adjust strategy - e.g., clone into subdirs within temp_clone, or handle one repo per task). **Current procedure assumes one primary remote repo if cloned.**
                *   Add `[temp_clone_path]` to `[final_source_paths]`.
            *   If it's a local path:
                *   Add the local path directly to `[final_source_paths]`.
    *   **Outputs:** Cloned repository content within `[temp_clone_path]` (if applicable). `[final_source_paths]` list for the next step.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report Git clone failures back to coordinator.

*   **Step 5: Determine & Confirm Chunking Strategy (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX, User)**
    *   **Description:** Analyze source structure and confirm the chunking approach with the user.
    *   **Inputs:** `[final_source_paths]` (from Step 4).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Analyze the structure of the paths in `[final_source_paths]` (e.g., depth, file types, directory organization).
        2.  Based on the analysis, formulate 2-3 relevant chunking strategy options (e.g., `"directory"`, `"file"`, potentially custom grouping logic if applicable).
        3.  Use `ask_followup_question` to present these strategies to the user:
            *   **Question:** "Based on the source structure, which chunking strategy should Repomix use?"
            *   **Suggestions:** Provide the formulated options (e.g., "Use 'directory' strategy", "Use 'file' strategy", "Propose a custom strategy (requires manual config edit)").
        4.  Receive the user's selection. Store the chosen strategy (e.g., `"directory"`, `"file"`) as `[chunking_strategy]`.
    *   **Outputs:** User-confirmed `[chunking_strategy]` string.
    *   **Error Handling:** If user interaction fails or provides an invalid choice, default to `"directory"` and log a warning, or report blockage to coordinator.

*   **Step 6: Prepare `config.repomix.json` (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Generate the JSON configuration file for the `repomix` tool using the confirmed chunking strategy.
    *   **Inputs:** `[final_source_paths]` (from Step 4), `[task_directory]` (from Step 3), `[task_name]` (from Step 2), `[chunking_strategy]` (from Step 5).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Construct the JSON object content as a string:
            *   Set `"compress": true`.
            *   Populate `"sources"` array with the `[final_source_paths]`.
            *   Define `"outputs"` for single MD (`[task_directory]/[task_name].repomix.md`), single XML (`[task_directory]/[task_name].repomix.xml`), chunked MD (`[task_directory]/chunks_md/`), and chunked XML (`[task_directory]/chunks_xml/`).
            *   Define `"chunking"` using the user-selected `[chunking_strategy]` (e.g., `"strategy": "[chunking_strategy]"`), `"output_dir_md": "chunks_md"`, `"output_dir_xml": "chunks_xml"`.
        2.  Use `write_to_file` to save the JSON string to `[task_directory]/config.repomix.json`.
    *   **Outputs:** `config.repomix.json` file within `[task_directory]`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report failure to generate or write the config file back to coordinator.

*   **Step 7: Execute Repomix (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Run the `repomix` tool using the generated configuration.
    *   **Inputs:** Path to `config.repomix.json` (`[task_directory]/config.repomix.json`).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `execute_command` to run: `repomix --config [task_directory]/config.repomix.json`.
        2.  Monitor the command execution for success or failure.
    *   **Outputs:** Repomix output files (single, chunked) within `[task_directory]`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report `repomix` command execution errors back to coordinator.

*   **Step 8: Generate `README.md` (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Create a summary file describing the Repomix run.
    *   **Inputs:** `[source_list]` (from Step 1), `[task_directory]` (from Step 3), `[chunking_strategy]` (from Step 5). Information on whether cloning occurred (Step 4).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Construct the Markdown content for the README, including:
            *   Original sources requested (`[source_list]`).
            *   Mention if cloning occurred and where (`[temp_clone_path]`).
            *   List of generated output files/directories within `[task_directory]`.
            *   Chunking strategy used (`[chunking_strategy]`, confirmed by user).
        2.  Use `write_to_file` to save the content to `[task_directory]/README.md`.
    *   **Outputs:** `README.md` file within `[task_directory]`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report failure to generate or write the README back to coordinator.

*   **Step 9: Cleanup Temporary Clone (If Applicable) (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Remove the temporary directory used for cloning remote repositories.
    *   **Inputs:** `[temp_clone_path]` (from Step 3). Information on whether cloning occurred (Step 4).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  If a temporary clone was created in Step 4:
            *   Use `execute_command`: `rm -rf [temp_clone_path]`. Verify OS-specific syntax (`rm -rf` is common on Linux/macOS; PowerShell might use `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force [temp_clone_path]`). Adhere to Rule `05-os-aware-commands.md`.
    *   **Outputs:** Temporary clone directory removed.
    *   **Error Handling:** Log cleanup errors, but potentially proceed to reporting unless the error is critical. Report cleanup issues to coordinator.

*   **Step 10: Report Completion (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX)**
    *   **Description:** Notify the initiating agent of the core workflow outcome (prior to optional archiving).
    *   **Inputs:** Success/failure status of core generation, path to `[task_directory]/README.md`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  If steps 1-9 were successful, use `<attempt_completion>` with a success message, providing the full path to `[task_directory]/README.md`, and indicating the next step is optional archiving.
        2.  If any step 1-9 failed critically, use `<attempt_completion>` reporting the failure and the specific step/error encountered.
    *   **Outputs:** Completion or error report sent to the coordinator.

*   **Step 11: Offer Artifact Archiving (MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX / Coordinator, User)**
    *   **Description:** Ask the user if they want to copy key generated artifacts to the central context directory. This step runs only if Step 10 reported success.
    *   **Inputs:** `[task_directory]` (from Step 3), `[task_name]` (from Step 2).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `ask_followup_question`:
            *   **Question:** "Repomix generation complete in `[task_directory]`. Do you want to copy any artifacts to `.ruru/context/` for broader access?"
            *   **Suggestions:**
                *   "Copy `[task_name].repomix.md` to `.ruru/context/`"
                *   "Copy `[task_name].repomix.xml` to `.ruru/context/`"
                *   "Copy specific chunk file(s) (Specify paths relative to `[task_directory]`)"
                *   "Do not copy anything"
        2.  If the user selects an option involving copying:
            *   Construct the appropriate `cp` command(s) based on the selection and `[task_directory]`. Ensure OS-aware commands (Rule `05`). Target directory is `.ruru/context/`.
            *   Use `execute_command` to perform the copy operation(s).
            *   Log the copy operation.
    *   **Outputs:** Potentially copied files in `.ruru/context/`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Report copy command failures if they occur.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   The user has provided the source paths/URLs.
*   The user has confirmed the task name.
*   The user has confirmed the chunking strategy.
*   The `repomix` analysis has been successfully executed.
*   All specified output files (single MD/XML, chunked MD/XML) exist within the `[task_directory]`.
*   A `README.md` file summarizing the run exists within the `[task_directory]`.
*   The temporary clone directory (if created) has been removed.
*   The user has been prompted regarding artifact archiving, and any requested copies have been attempted.
*   The `prime-coordinator` (or initiator) has received a completion report including the path to the `README.md`.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   Failures in critical steps (user interaction for inputs, directory creation, cloning, config generation, repomix execution) should be reported immediately to the `prime-coordinator` via `<attempt_completion>`, halting the workflow.
*   Failures in non-critical steps (README generation, cleanup, artifact copying) should be logged and reported, but the workflow might still be considered partially successful if the core Repomix outputs were generated.
*   The `MODE-SPEC-REPOMIX` agent should provide specific error messages encountered during `execute_command` calls when reporting failures.
*   Refer to the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.ruru/processes/afr-process.md`) if standard error handling fails.
