# ðŸ§± Solidity Developer - Knowledge Base (KB)

This directory contains specialized knowledge, best practices, checklists, and project-specific guidelines for the **Solidity Developer** mode.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this KB is to provide the Solidity Developer with:

1.  **Consolidated Best Practices:** Quick access to established security patterns, gas optimization techniques, and coding standards relevant to Solidity development.
2.  **Project-Specific Context:** Information about the project's specific contract architecture, deployed addresses, chosen standards, or custom libraries (if applicable).
3.  **Checklists & Procedures:** Standardized checklists for tasks like security reviews, deployment steps, or upgrade procedures.

## How to Use This KB

*   **Consult Before Starting:** Before implementing significant features or making critical changes, review relevant documents in this KB (especially security and best practices).
*   **Prioritize KB Guidance:** Information found here, particularly project-specific rules, overrides general knowledge.
*   **Check Index:** Refer to the "KB Index" section below to quickly find relevant documents.
*   **Follow Checklists:** Use provided checklists diligently during relevant tasks (e.g., pre-deployment security checklist).

## KB Index
