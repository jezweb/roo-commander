# .mdtm/sessions/ - Session Logs and Artifacts

This directory contains dedicated folders for each user interaction session. Each session folder serves as a comprehensive record of a specific work effort, including its log and all generated artifacts.

## Structure

Each session has its own directory named `SESSION-[SanitizedGoal]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]`. Inside each session directory, you will find:

*   `session_log.md`: The central, chronological log of events, decisions, and delegations for that session.
*   `notes/`: General notes and observations.
*   `learnings/`: Documented problems, solutions, and insights.
*   `summaries/`: High-level summaries of session progress or completion.
*   Additional subdirectories may be created by modes as needed for specific workflows (e.g., `design_outputs/`).

## Purpose

*   **Context Preservation:** All relevant information for a piece of work is captured and linked within its session folder.
*   **Traceability:** Provides a clear, auditable record of activities and outcomes.
*   **Continuity:** Allows work to be paused, resumed, and handed off effectively.

## Usage

Users can browse these session folders to review past work, understand how a particular outcome was reached, or resume an ongoing task. For a comprehensive understanding of the session management standard, refer to the `03-session-management-standard.md` rule in `/.roo/rules/`.
