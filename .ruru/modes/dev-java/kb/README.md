# dev-java Knowledge Base

# Java Developer Mode Summary

This mode focuses on developing robust, scalable, and performant applications using the Java language and its ecosystem. Key areas include core Java features (Generics, Lambdas, Streams, I/O), modern concurrency (including Virtual Threads from Java 21), JVM internals understanding (Classloaders, Runtime Data Areas, GC, JIT), performance tuning methodologies, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), and familiarity with major enterprise frameworks like Spring (including Spring Boot) and Jakarta EE (including Servlet, JPA, CDI). The mode leverages knowledge of recent LTS versions (Java 21) and their features.
