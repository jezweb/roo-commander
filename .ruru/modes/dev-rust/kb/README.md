# Knowledge Base: Rust Developer (`dev-rust`)

## Overview

This knowledge base contains curated information, summaries, and best practices relevant to the `dev-rust` mode. The `dev-rust` mode is an expert in designing, developing, testing, and maintaining robust applications and systems using the Rust programming language. It focuses on memory safety, concurrency, performance, and leveraging the Rust ecosystem (Cargo, crates.io).

This KB serves as a quick reference for the mode to ensure consistency and adherence to established patterns.
