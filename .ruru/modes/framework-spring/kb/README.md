# Knowledge Base: framework-spring (üçÉ Java Spring Developer)

This KB provides synthesized knowledge about the Java Spring Framework, focusing on core concepts, setup, web handling, data access (JPA), security, AOP, testing, and common patterns/pitfalls for advanced development.

## KB Files

*   **`framework-overview.md` (20 lines):** Provides a high-level overview of the Spring Framework's philosophy (IoC/DI, AOP), core concepts, modular architecture, primary use cases, and key benefits, including Spring Boot's role.
*   **`setup-installation-summary.md` (36 lines):** Covers Spring Boot project setup using Initializr, the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, configuration via `application.properties`/`yml`, externalized configuration, profiles, and type-safe binding with `@ConfigurationProperties`. Includes a typical directory structure.
*   **`routing-summary.md` (23 lines):** Explains how Spring MVC (using `@RequestMapping` variants and `HandlerInterceptor`) and Spring WebFlux (using functional endpoints or annotations with `WebFilter`) handle HTTP request mapping to controller methods, including path variables and parameters.
*   **`request-handling-summary.md` (32 lines):** Details how Spring controllers handle requests, access data (using annotations like `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestBody`), generate responses (view resolution, `@ResponseBody`, `ResponseEntity` in MVC/WebFlux), and manage exceptions using `@ExceptionHandler` and `@ControllerAdvice`.
*   **`database-orm-summary.md` (28 lines):** Explains how Spring Data JPA simplifies database access using interface-based repositories, query derivation, `@Query`, custom implementations, projections, specifications, and Query by Example. Also covers auditing, pagination, transactions, and common performance pitfalls.
*   **`middleware-lifecycle-summary.md` (39 lines):** Differentiates between Spring AOP (general method interception for cross-cutting concerns), Spring MVC Interceptors (`HandlerInterceptor` for web requests before/after controller methods), and Spring WebFlux Filters (`WebFilter` for reactive web request interception). Explains their concepts, purpose, definition, registration, and execution flow.
*   **`authentication-authorization-summary.md` (35 lines):** Outlines Spring Security's core concepts, covering authentication mechanisms (Form, Basic, JWT, LDAP, SAML, OAuth2), core components (`AuthenticationManager`, `UserDetailsService`), and configuration via `HttpSecurity`. Also details authorization strategies (RBAC, Permissions, ACLs) and configuration methods (URL-based, Method Security with `@PreAuthorize`/`@PostAuthorize`).
*   **`templating-summary.md` (20 lines):** Describes Spring MVC's integration with server-side template engines (like Thymeleaf, FreeMarker) via `ViewResolver`, data passing using `Model`, and layout/fragment support. Mentions WebFlux support and the common API-focused approach using `@RestController`.
*   **`testing-summary.md` (37 lines):** Describes Spring Boot testing strategies including unit tests (JUnit, Mockito), slice tests (`@WebMvcTest`, `@DataJpaTest`, etc.), and full integration tests (`@SpringBootTest`). Covers key tools like `MockMvc`, `WebTestClient`, `@MockBean`, `TestEntityManager`, Testcontainers, and best practices.
*   **`dependency-injection-summary.md` (43 lines):** Explains the core concepts of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring using the `ApplicationContext`. Covers bean definition (`@Component`, `@Bean`), component scanning, injection types (constructor, setter, field - preferring constructor), and resolving ambiguity (`@Primary`, `@Qualifier`).
