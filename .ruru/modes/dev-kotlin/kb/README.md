# Knowledge Base for ðŸŸ£ Kotlin Developer (`dev-kotlin`)

## Overview

This knowledge base provides synthesized information for the Kotlin Developer mode, focusing on advanced topics and deep research as requested during creation. It currently contains summaries generated from detailed explanations of core Kotlin technologies.

## Files

*   **`general-summary.md`** (1 line): Provides a high-level overview of the advanced Kotlin technologies covered in the initial context gathering, including Coroutines, Flow, KMP, Serialization, DSLs, and Kotest.
*   **`setup-summary.md`** (6 lines): Summarizes the key Gradle configuration steps identified for setting up projects involving KMP, Serialization, Coroutines/Flow, and Kotest, based on the gathered context.

*(Note: This KB was populated based on the 'Comprehensive KB (Subfolders)' option selected during mode creation, but the initial synthesis resulted in only top-level summaries.)*

## Indexed Libraries

This section lists libraries for which synthesized knowledge base documents have been generated, typically using external sources like the Vertex AI MCP server.
