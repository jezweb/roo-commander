# .mdtm/ - Markdown-Driven Task Management Files

This directory serves as the central repository for all Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files generated and managed by Roo Commander modes. It is designed to provide a clear, traceable, and human-readable record of all delegated tasks and work sessions.

## Structure

*   `tasks/`: Contains individual MDTM task files.
*   `sessions/`: Contains session logs and related artifacts.

## Purpose

*   **Task Tracking:** All delegated tasks, from high-level objectives to granular sub-tasks, are recorded here.
*   **Session Traceability:** Each work session has a dedicated log and associated artifacts for comprehensive context.
*   **Human Readability:** Files are in TOML+Markdown format, making them easy to read and understand.
*   **AI Interaction:** Roo Commander modes interact with these files to manage workflows, update progress, and log events.

## Usage

Users can inspect the contents of this directory to understand the current state of ongoing work, review past sessions, and examine task details.

**Do not manually modify files in this directory unless you fully understand the MDTM standard and the potential impact on active workflows.**
